# Binary search tree

A straightforward method is used to create the binary search tree.

`[6, 3, 19, 2, 17, 26, 0, 34, 12, 16]`

`6` is the root node
`3` is less than root so its left of the root node
`19` is greater than root node so its right of root node
`2` is lesser root node and than the parent node `3` so its left of it
`17` is greater than the root node so its left child of `19`
